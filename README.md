# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand gestures in real time and control LEDs connected to an ESP32 microcontroller over Wi-Fi. Each finger movement is mapped to a specific LED, enabling intuitive, contactless interaction through simple Python code and ESP32 HTTP requests.
